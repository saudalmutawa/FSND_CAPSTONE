The Celebrities API project is a project where you can add, delete, update and view actors and movies.
There are 2 user roles who can manipulate movies and actors.

* DIRECTED ROLE: GET movies and actors, DELETE actors, UPDATE movies and actors, POST actors.
* EXECUTIVE ROLE: GET movies and actors, DELETE movies and actors, update movies and actors, POST movies and actors (DOES IT ALL).

## Local Development

### Installing Dependencies
1. **Python 3.7** - Follow instructions to install the latest version of python for your platform in the [python docs](https://docs.python.org/3/using/unix.html#getting-and-installing-the-latest-version-of-python)
2. **Virtual Enviornment** - We recommend working within a virtual environment whenever using Python for projects. This keeps your dependencies for each project separate and organaized. Instructions for setting up a virual enviornment for your platform can be found in the [python docs](https://packaging.python.org/guides/installing-using-pip-and-virtual-environments/)
3. **PIP Dependencies** - Once you have your virtual environment setup and running, install dependencies by naviging to the `/backend` directory and running:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
This will install all of the required packages we selected within the `requirements.txt` file.

### Running the server

To run the server, execute:

```bash
flask run --reload
```
### Unittesting the application
To test the application locally run the following command

```bash
python test_app.py
```

## API Reference
ALL API endpoints can be accessed via https://moviecapstonefsnd.herokuapp.com/
Auth0 authentication require some information can be found in setup.sh


### Error Handling
Errors are returned as JSON objects in the following format:
```bash
{
    "success": False, 
    "error": 400,
    "message": "bad request"

```
The API will return three error types when requests fail:
* 400: Bad Request
